 Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes. These people are called visitors (which may be either tourists or excursionists; residents or non-residents) and tourism has to do with their activities 

 * Economic. It brings in money. This is probably the main advantage of tourism and the reason why it has been promoted so much, especially in developing countries.

 * Opportunistic. It provides jobs. Hotels, bars, transport, activities, shops, and restaurants all need staffing. Tourism can provide much-needed employment for people.

 * Infrastructural. It provides a means and an incentive for investment in infrastructure such as roads, rail networks, and local medical and education facilities.

 * Environmental. It can provide economic incentives for a place to preserve, maintain, and regenerate the environment in both urban and rural settings.

 * Cross-Cultural. It promotes international connections which can bring more business and cultural collaborations in the long term.
